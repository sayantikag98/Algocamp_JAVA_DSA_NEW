        A. (CHAT-GPT)
        In Java, when you perform an operation on two variables of a primitive data type (such as char),
         the result is promoted to the wider of the two data types involved in the operation.
         In the case of ch = ch + 5;, the right-hand side of the expression involves an addition
         of a char (ch) and an int (5). According to the rules of binary numeric promotion in Java,
         the char is promoted to an int before the addition takes place. The result of the addition
         is then assigned back to ch, but since ch is of type char, a narrowing conversion is required,
          and this is where the error occurs.

        Let's break it down step by step:

        step 1: ch is a char.
        step 2: 5 is an int.
        step 3: The addition ch + 5 involves binary numeric promotion, so ch is promoted to an int.
        step 4: The result of the addition is of type int.
        step 5: Assigning this int result back to ch requires a narrowing conversion,
                and this is where the error occurs because narrowing conversions in Java require an explicit cast.

        On the other hand, when you write ch = 'a' + 5;, the right-hand side involves a constant expression ('a' + 5).
         During compilation, the compiler can evaluate this constant expression and determine that the result
         can fit into a char. Therefore, it doesn't raise an error, and the assignment is allowed.

         In java char is 16-bit unsigned integer, smallest unsigned 16-bit number is 0 and the largest is 65535.
         So if we do ch = 'a' + (65535 - 97), the compiler evaluates this constant expression and result is within
         the bounds of character so no error is thrown. Any value greater than 65535-97 (65438) will throw error.

        If you want to avoid the error in the first case, you can perform an explicit cast:
        ch = (char) (ch + 5);

        This tells the compiler that you are aware of the potential loss of information due to the narrowing
        conversion, and you are explicitly allowing it.
